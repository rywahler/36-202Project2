 Titanic Survivors.
This project takes raw data from the titanic manifesto and whether or not the individual died from the sinking. The goal of this project is to determine what factors can best account for a passengerâ€™s chance of survival. Some machine learning topics were used in this project, so we have randomly divided the manifesto into a training set and a testing set. To give the reader comprehension over the training data box plots were created for each of the quantitative factors against the binary survived and bar plots for the categorical factors against the binary survived outcome. For modeling, linear discriminant analysis and quadratic discriminant analysis were performed for the quantitative variables. Additional classifications trees using the random forest library and binary logistic regression were used to incorporate the categorical variables. It was found that the Classification did the best in classifying survivorship after pruning that removed an element of over fitting. Note, I have lost the rmd file, but the pdf document has much of the code displayed that should allow understanding of what methods in R were used.
